The goal of that project was to gain experience in understanding the “lay of the (data) land” and to perform descriptive analytics on your data set.\n","\n","In this second and complementary project you will explore a theme in machine learning. Consider a task T, experience E in performing that task, and a performance metric P measuring how well we perform task T. Learning (in machines and humans) aims to provide a boost in performance with more experience ΔE i.e., P(T, E+ΔE) > P(T,E).\n","Recall that machine learning tasks are categorized into three broad categories (i) supervised (ii) unsupervised (iii) reinforcement learning. Within these categories, for this project, you are welcome to explore any machine learning task of your preference e.g., classification, recommendation, prediction, clustering, association etc. Scikit-learn and Spark MLlib provides a variety of tools for machine learning. You will perform and report your work with a Jupyter Notebook.\n","\n","At the highest level, in this project, you will have the following intertwined activities \n","    (a) pick a data set of your choice \n","    (b) in tandem identify a machine learning task \n","    (c) perform experiments using the data set and library of tools \n","    (d) report your experience and observations. \n","\n","As has been the theme of this course, you are expected to go beyond the just running your data set on a range of ML algorithms.

Can you translate the delayed arrivals to loss revenue? Customer dissatisfaction?

To seed the search, following are some websites of projects from courses on machine learning: Stanford Machine Learning 2016 2018 2021. Please keep in mind that these are projects from courses exclusively devoted to machine learning. Our course has had a much broader Data Science perspective.

All that was important to them was to take care of others. They neglected their own health for a long time. Only after seeing closely how cancer can destroy people's lives, they started paying attention to getting regularly tested by a medical professional. We as a team feel that making breast cancer diagnosis part of regular tests for women can play a strong role in improving women's healthcare as prevention is better than cure.\n","\n","By leveraging the power of AI, Machine Learning data, we can create a more proactive and personalized approach to healthcare that can benefit everyone, including those who may not have been aware of the importance of regular checkups. Encouraging women to prioritize their own health and well-being can also have far-reaching effects on their families and communities, making it a vital step in improving public health overall.\n","\n","When Professor discussed about Zoll in the class and how it saved people's live from heart attack, it made us thinking about other ways to help fight health issues using technology.
